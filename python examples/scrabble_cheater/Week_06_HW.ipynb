    "#### Alex West\n",
    "\n",
    "As a complete beginner to programming in general, \"readability\" was initially a difficult concept. As I've become conversational, however, it makes perfect sense to me that style guides on Python are meticulously maintained. \"Code is read much more often than it is written\" -- this stuck out to me right off the bat, since I hadn't really thought about it except when I do my own homework. But it makes sense, and because of this, code needs to be readable by a diverse group of people. Hence, agreed upon style guidelines. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, what stuck out to me was the unbelievable detail. Again, upon reflection, not surprising. Of course there should be rules about 4 spaces vs. tabs, 79 characters per line, etc. It's not unlike writing grammar rules for a foreign language. However, the \"2 spaces after a sentence ending period\" within a comment rule seems excessive and a product of a bygone era. The font is reminiscent of typewriters, so maybe that's where it comes from. But it certainly isn't followed in contemporary written word. In addition, the rule that non-English speakers should write comments in English unless \"120% sure\" it will never be read by anyone outside the language... seemed a bit dramatic and out of character for the authors of a programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "I learned a lot reading through the style guide. Much of what was there made sense, and it showed me that the human brain has a natural capacity for form and style. In other words, I was internalizing a lot of this style convention without knowing it, simply by coding along with the professors during the async material. Looking at some of the \"No\" examples I automatically shook my head; \"It looks wrong.\" How did I know that? \n",
    "\n",
    "As with most grammar and style, reading and internalizing the conventions makes you a better writer / coder. For example, \"When catching exceptions, mention specific exceptions whenever possible instead of using a bare except: clause.\" This resonated in particular. If you keep you exceptions specific, you'll be writing better code. \n",
    "\n",
    "There were elements to the style guide I couldn't quite understand (the API stuff specifically) but it's nice to know that it's there whenever I need to look something up. \n"

    "Write a Python script that takes a Scrabble rack as a command-line argument and prints all valid Scrabble words that can be constructed from that rack, along with their Scrabble scores, sorted by score. Valid Scrabble words are provided in the data source below. A Scrabble rack is made up of a maximum of any 7 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the requirements for the program:\n",
    "- This needs to be able to be run as a command line tool as shown below (not an input statement!)\n",
    "- Please name the python file: `scrabble.py`\n",
    "- Allow anywhere from 2-7 character tiles to be inputted \n",
    "- Do not worry about the number of the same tiles (e.g. a user is allowed to input ZZZZZQQ)\n",
    "- Output the **total** list of words as (score, word) tuples, sorted by the score as shown below\n",
    "- Output at the end the 'Total number of words:' that can be made with the letters\n",
    "- Please include a function called `score_word` in a separate module. Import this function into your main solution code.\n",
    "- You need to handle input errors from the user and suggest what that error might be caused by and how to fix it (i.e. a helpful error message)\n",
    "- Implement wildcards as either `*` or `?`. That is, let the user specify a wildcard character that can take any value. There can be a total of two wild cards in any user input (one of each character). Only use the `*` and `?` as wildcard characters\n",
    "- Wildcard characters are scored as 0 points, just like in the real Scrabble game\n",
    "- Your program should take less than a minute to run with 2 wildcards in the input - if it is more time than that your algorithm is not optimized very well!\n",

    "- We recommend that you work on this and try to break down the problems into steps on your own before writing any code. Once you've scoped generally what you want to do, start writing some code and if you get stuck, take a step back and go back to thinking about the problem rather than trying to fix lots of errors at the code level. You should only use the Python standard library in this assignment, however any tool in the standard library is fair game.\n",
    "- If you keep getting stuck check out: https://openhatch.org/wiki/Scrabble_challenge. This is where we got the idea for this assignment and it provides some helpful tips for guiding you along the way. If that link doesn't work you can use the Google cached version here. However, we would recommend that you try to implement this first before looking at the hints on the website.\n",
